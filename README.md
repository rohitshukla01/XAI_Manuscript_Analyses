# Predicting Phytoplankton Dynamics with Explainable AI

This project uses machine learning and explainable AI (XAI) to predict and understand the phytoplankton dynamics in the Falling Creek and Beaverdam Reservoirs in Virginia, USA. By analyzing environmental variables collected at the sites, we uncover the hidden patterns driving phytoplankton dynamics, offering insights for both water quality management and ecological research.

## 📁 Project Structure


### Step 1: Fetch the Data

To begin the analysis, you first need to compile the dataset from the Virginia LTREB Reservoirs monitoring program. You can do this by following steps below:

  - Run the R code from the GitHub Repository (https://github.com/abreefpilz/Reservoirs/blob/master/Scripts/Daily_avg_RS.R)

The script automatically fetches the required data packages directly from the EDI Repository API portal (given below), processes the variables, and saves the final output as a .csv file.

Running this script will reproduce the FCR_BVR_Met_daily_obs_2019_2024.csv used for this project (uploaded here). 


### Step 2: Data Analysis and Visualization

Once the data are retrieved/loaded, the next step is to perform an exploratory data analysis (EDA). 


  -  The chl-a_timeseries.ipynb notebook is provided for this purpose.

 This script processes the phytoplankton (chlorophyll-a) data, visualizes trends, and generates plots to understand the dataset's characteristics.

 ### Step 3: ML-XAI implemenation

The machine learning and explainable AI analyses are performed in two separate Jupyter Notebooks, with one dedicated to each reservoir as descibed below:

  - Falling Creek Reservoir (FCR)

  - FCR_XAI_ANALYSES_REVIEW-2.ipynb



Contains the complete ML models and SHAP analyses with figures for the FCR.

  -  Beaverdam Reservoir (BVR)

  -  BVR_XAI_ANALYSES_REVIEW.ipynb



Contains the complete ML models and SHAP analyses with figures for the BVR.
